# EtchASketch

Etch a Sketch is a project in HTML, CSS and Javascript to practise DOM manipulation using Javascript.
To use the project:
  - Select your canvas size (from 1x1 to 64x64)
  - Choose your color from the color palette (Don't worry, you can still change colors after starting your piece of art without loosing your work)
  - Choose whether to paint (hover your mouse over the canvas) or to draw (click on a particular cell you want to color)
  - If you made a mistake don't worry! You can still use the eraser to erase and continue your art!
  - Whenever you are done with your artwork, you can press on "Clear" and start a new canvas!
  - Bonus: You can have fun with the Rainbow functionality which paints the canvas with amazing colors!
